Encrypt PHP session data using files
----------------------------------------------
The encryption is built using mcrypt extension 
and the randomness is managed by openssl
The default encryption algorithm is Rijndael-256
and we use CBC+HMAC (Encrypt-then-mac)

How to use it
-------------
Include the SecureSession.php in your project and use
the PHP session as usual.

Demo
----
In the demo folder you can see a simple PHP script (demo.php)
that stores some data in $_SESSION and display the encrypted
data of the session file (stored in the temporary directory
of the operating system, e.g. /tmp in GNU/Linux).
